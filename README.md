A simple note taking desktop application.

This desktop app is built using JavaFX. The owner of this repository and hence the project chose not to work with `FXML` as it is optional.
This project does not follow any specific Application Architecture that separates the UI logic with business logic perfectly.
## NOTE: Future wants may force to change the architecture of application which may include `MVVM` application architecture. For now the comments at the right place is enough to make it understandable.

### This project is a submission for the SWOC hackathon hosted on [Devfolio](https://devfolio.co/discover).

## Instructions for running the application:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the latest version of Java and JavaFX installed on your system.
3. Open IntelliJ IDEA and select "File" > "New" > "Project from Version Control" > "Git".
4. Enter the URL of the repository and clone it to a directory on your local machine.
5. Open the cloned repository as a project in IntelliJ IDEA.
6. Ensure that the JavaFX SDK is properly configured as a project library.
7. Right-click on the Main class or the class containing the main method and select "Run" to launch the JavaFX application.
