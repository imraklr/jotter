A simple note taking desktop application.

## Project Details

This project is a submission for the SWOC hackathon hosted on [Devfolio](https://devfolio.co/discover).

The owner of this repository and the project chose not to work with `FXML`, as it is optional. While this project may not strictly adhere to a specific Application Architecture that completely separates UI logic from business logic, it still employs effective techniques to ensure clear separation of concerns and maintainability.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Java (version 19)
- JavaFX

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open IntelliJ IDEA and select "File" > "New" > "Project from Version Control" > "Git".
3. Enter the URL of the repository and clone it to a directory on your local machine.
4. Open the cloned repository as a project in IntelliJ IDEA.
5. Ensure that the JavaFX SDK is properly configured as a project library.
6. Right-click on the `Entry` class or the class containing the main method and select "Run" to launch the JavaFX application or navigate to `Entry.java` and press the run button to run the application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues building the JAR file or the JAR executable isn't built at all, it may be because this project uses Java 19. However, you can still test the application by running it. The default entry point for the application is the `Entry` class.

We hope you find this application useful!

Made with ❤️
