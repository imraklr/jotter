A simple note taking desktop application.

This desktop app is built using JavaFX. The owner of this repository and hence the project chose not to work with `FXML` as it is optional.
This project does not follow any specific Application Architecture that separates the UI logic with business logic perfectly.
## NOTE: Future wants may force to change the architecture of application which may include `MVVM` application architecture. For now the comments at the right place is enough to make it understandable.

### This project is a submission for the SWOC hackathon hosted on [Devfolio](https://devfolio.co/discover).
